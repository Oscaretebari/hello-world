At a moment, I am a PC Tech that was asked to Install PSI for a developer and I dont have slightest clue how to install and configure it on Windows server 2012 Domain controller. I need to find step-by-step direction to install the requirements as well such as:
* The PsiMedia 1.0.x plugin and the qca-ossl plugin are
needed to activate

     
the voice calling feature


QCA --

    * QCA 2.x is required to build Psi.

    * The qca-ossl and qca-gnupg plugins are
desirable for full functionality

      of Psi.
